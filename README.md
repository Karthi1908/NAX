# NAX - Neo Assets Exchange

Neo Assets Exchange is decentralised exchange for trading the perpetual contracts on crypto and NFT assets and it is run on Tezos.
NAX is experimental exchange for trading new assets such as perps on NFTs, Metaverse tokens and other crypto assets with Tezos as transaction/settlement currency.
The main aim of the exchange is provide exposure to all assets to the Tezos Hodlers without having to convert to other crypto or trade in new exchange.

### Perpetual contracts (PERPs)

Perpetual contracts are leveraged derivative products enable user to take exposure ( buy or sell) in an asset without actually holding the asset.
Since leverage is allowed in trading perps, users can hold more assets by depositing only the margin amount. 
For conventional futures contracts such as WTI, the contract’s price will gradually converge with the underlying asset’s spot market price as the expiry date approaches. For a perpetual contract, to converge its price with the spot market, the most effective method used in the industry is “funding rate”

NAX Prepetual(nPreps) uses modified Constant Function Market Maker (mCFMM) as a price discovery mechanism. https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/constant-function-market-makers-defis-zero-to-one-innovation-968f77022159

nPreps use the constant product function  X * Y = K ( same as Uniswap). However for nPerps, there will be no swap of assets.
